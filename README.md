Title: Restaurant Menu with Cart and Checkout

Description:
This project is a simple restaurant menu web application that allows users to browse through a list of dishes, add them to the cart, and checkout. The cart displays the selected items along with their quantities and prices. The users can also remove items from the cart if they change their mind. Additionally, there is a feature to generate and download an image of the cart, which includes the list of items, the total amount, the restaurant name, and the current date and time.

Features:

Responsive Restaurant Menu: The menu displays a list of dishes with their respective images and prices. Users can click the "Add to Cart" button to add a dish to the cart.

Cart Functionality: The cart shows the selected items along with their quantities. Users can adjust the quantity by clicking on the "+" and "-" buttons or remove items by clicking the "Remove" button.

Checkout: The "Checkout" button allows users to generate and download an image of the cart, which includes the list of items, the total amount, the restaurant name, and the current date and time.

Stylish Design: The web application is designed with a simple and elegant layout. The menu items and cart are presented in a clean and organized manner.

Browse through the menu items and click the "Add to Cart" button to select items.
View the cart by clicking the "Cart" button to see the selected items and their quantities.
Adjust the item quantities or remove items as needed.
Click the "Checkout" button to generate and download an image of the cart.
Note: The downloaded image includes the list of selected items, the total amount, the restaurant name, and the current date and time. The "Remove" buttons are excluded from the downloaded image to ensure a clean and presentable view.
